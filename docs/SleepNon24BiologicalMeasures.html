Last update: June 2021.
</p>

<p>
This project aims to provide a complete set of clinical-grade devices to monitor over the long-term (1 week to a year) various factors that are well-established in influencing or reflecting the circadian rhythm. In clinical jargon, the aim is to devise wearables for the non-invasive ambulatory supervised monitoring and self-monitoring of human circadian rhythm.
</p>

<p>
Indeed, there is a lack of both accurate and non-invasive and durable devices to monitor the human circadian rhythm: often, the devices are invasive (such as for core body temperature sensing), or are inaccurate (wrist PPG instead of ECG, low sampling rate), and even when these two criteria are met, most devices cannot last at least 24h, which makes them unusable to monitor a full circadian cycle, especially for circadian rhythm disorders such as non-24 where one cycle can be much longer than 24h. However, to allow for self-monitoring of the circadian rhythm, a device needs to fulfill at least these 3 criteria (and more). This project aims to provide a set of devices to capture most of the biological signals that can objectively reflect or affect the human circadian rhythm.
</p>

<p>
To achieve that, we repurpose off-the-shelf components and devices where possible, or create new ones with DIY Arduino boards where necessary. This repository will contain all the instructions to detail what components and devices are necessary, how to use them, and for the custom devices the hardware and software source codes are provided. Softwares to visualize and (rudimentarily) analyze the generated data is also provided.
</p>

<p>
This technical document describes each device's setup, donning procedure and data acquisition.
</p>

<p>
Wearables list:<br>
<ul>
<li>Polar H10 (ECG + 3-axis actigraphy), combined with long battery dedicated Android smartphone <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/realme_6i-10130.php" title="Realme i6" class="https">Realme i6</a> (160€) and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.j_ware.polarsensorlogger" title="this android app" class="https">this android app</a>.</li>
<li>GreenTEG CORE (core body temperature + trunk skin temperature).</li>
<li>Axivity AX6 (6-axis actigraphy).</li>
<li>iButtons DS1925L (or DS1925EVKIT starter kit) on a cotton sports wrist-band attached with a velcro (wrist skin temperature).</li>
<li>Custom arduino-based photosensor (light intensity and color sensor).</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
After many iterations, since 2021-01-21 the system consists in 3 wearables:<br>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>on a chest belt, the following sensors are attached: the ECG Polar H10 in the center of the trunk + Core body temperature sensor GreenTEG CORE on the side of the trunk using a DIY velcro scratch and loop.</li>
<li>on the non-dominant (here: left) forearm, the subject wears a cotton sports wrist band with the 3 iButtons to measure wrist skin temperature or ambient temperature + 6-axis actigraphy device AX-6 on the exterior. They are all attached with velcro on the cotton wrist band.</li>
<li>a pendant hung on a necklace, with a photosensor for light intensity and color. This device is not yet realized.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
The data generated by all these wearables can be visualized using their respective softwares or in the context of circadian rhythm analysis with the following companion tool: <a href="https://github.com/Circadiaware/circalizer" title="https://github.com/Circadiaware/circalizer" class="https">https://github.com/Circadiaware/circalizer</a>

<h2>Wearables donning procedure</h2>

<br>

<h3>General procedures for all wearables</h3>

<p>
<ul>
<li>Method wearables avoid superficial skin damage:
<ul>
<li><b>BEST CRITICAL: Move wearable belt up or down every day and before sleeping and anytime whenever the wearables feel itchy.</b> This is necessary to avoid skin damage and reduce itchiness when worn 24/7. In practice this was found to be the most effective strategy, allowing to wear the wearables for a virtually unlimited length of time. It's also necessary to clean up the wearables with a tissue imbibed in alcohol from time to time (about once a week).
<ul>
<li>Also avoid tightening belts too much. <b>The more pressure, the faster skin will be damaged or itchy.</b> The sweet spot is tightening just enough to ensure reliable and robust skin contact with the sensors, but not more than that.</li>
<li>It's necessary to re-do this procedure anytime the wearables feel itchy. The sooner the wearables are moved and pressure loosened, the less damage the skin will sustain. By taking on the habit of doing this as soon as itchiness feelings appear, it's possible to wear the devices continuously 24/7 (the author could wear the wearables continuously for 2 weeks).</li>
<li>Use this opportunity to check and re-position if necessary the sensors to ensure good skin contact (ie, the whole surface of the sensor must be in contact with the skin). Checking and repositioning sensors must become a regular habit.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>BEST CRITICAL: Avoid using sticky-based patch wearables or tape-based wearables, as adhesives will worsen irritation and are thus inadequate for continuous 24/7 long term wearing.
<ul>
<li>It's important to avoid any wearable that requires the use of medical tape or sticky gel patches/electrodes, as they may feel comfortable at first but will invariable produce a skin reaction after some time (usually a few days). For continuous wear, it's necessary to use wearables that can be in contact with the skin without any adhesive, such as by strapping a belt.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Other strategies that did not work as well:
<ul>
<li>Good but does not allow for continuous wear and cannot be applied to all wearables: Use silicone micropore because can be moved and retaped, for ibuttons. </li>
<li><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7147274/" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7147274/" class="https">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7147274/</a>
<ul>
<li>Not too much pressure, important to allow for blood circulation in the superficial skin layers.</li>
<li>"One study found that 52% of medical staff with hand eczema wash their hands more than 10 times per day.10 Long-term disinfectant use also influences the microbiota and changes the immune microenvironment on the skin surface, resulting in conditions such as eczema, fungal infection, bacterial infection, and allergic dermatitis."</li>
<li>"Adequate cleaning and moisturizing are the basis of skin barrier maintenance. An appropriate cleaning frequency removes dirt, bacteria, and some sweat and oil from the skin surface, which reduces the irritation caused by their long-term presence and reduces the risk of infection. Adequate moisturizing helps maintain the moisture content of the corneum, maintains the “brick-wall” structure of the epidermis, and facilitates cell self-repair.18 Basic moisturizing usually consists of two categories: the application of a water-soluble moisturizer (including glycerin and sodium hyaluronate) that supplements natural moisturizing factors to lock in moisture,19 and the application of squalane, mineral oils, and various natural oils to replenish sebum, which forms an oil film on the skin surface to prevent water loss. People with rich sebum in a closed equipment environment should use water-soluble moisturizers to prevent excessive oil from blocking the pores and causing acne."</li>
<li>"Acne treatment: Apart from wearing appropriate PPE and avoiding prolonged use, general treatments include: proper skin cleansing, a reasonable selection of skincare products (mainly water-soluble moisturizers and no hormones), a low-sugar diet, and avoidance of squeezing pimples with the hands."</li>
<li>WARNING source may not be very reliable: "Traditional Chinese medicine or photodynamic therapy can also be used."</li>
</ul>

<li>Essayer de mettre une compresse en dessous pour absorber humidité ! </li>
<li>Wearables change chestbelt position twice a day, at wake up and then before sleep.</li>
<li>Ibuttons with medical tape move every 1 or 2 days to the other armpit. With the silicone micropore tape, it's possible to reuse the same tape, it will still stick because no adhesive is used, it's based on pressure.</li>
<li>If itchy, don't hesitate to scratch gently and move the chest belt a bit. If the itchiness feeling is repeating, then it's a clear sign it's time to move the chest belt to another skin location.</li>
<li>For the chest belt any location on the chest as high as below the nipples or as low as the belly should work fine to acquire a sufficiently good ecg signal, as can be checked by looking at the graph and observing a QRS shaped complex.</li>
<li>It's the warmth and wetness and too tightness that causes skin irritation! <a href="https://www.muellersportsmed.com/blog/post/how-to-handle-skin-care-and-prevent-itching-when-wearing-a-brace" title="https://www.muellersportsmed.com/blog/post/how-to-handle-skin-care-and-prevent-itching-when-wearing-a-brace" class="https">https://www.muellersportsmed.com/blog/post/how-to-handle-skin-care-and-prevent-itching-when-wearing-a-brace</a>
<ul>
<li>"No matter what kind of brace you wear, skin has a universal response to being warmed and confined over a long period of time. Eventually, you will find yourself fighting the urge to scratch."</li>
<li>"If your skin can't breathe because the brace is too tight, you can also bring on a heat rash or a sweat rash, which will appear and feel much like a rash and make wearing your brace more uncomfortably itchy in the future."</li>
<li>"For many braces, the material of the brace is not necessarily absorbent or breathable, but cotton is. A layer of soft natural cotton between your skin and the brace can reduce chafing and the risk of forming a heat/sweat rash at the same time."</li>
<li>"Apply Powder to Prevent Heat and Sweat Rash"</li>
<li>"If you are experiencing excessive sweating and a moist sweat rash or heat rash, many people have found that this can be alleviated with a gentle layer of powder. Apply either <b>talcum powder or baby powder</b>, which are similar, to your skin or the inside of the brace before wearing to help both suppress sweat and create a soft absorbing layer between your skin and the brace material. Others have found relief with <b>lubricant like vaseline</b> instead, but this will depend on your needs and the type of brace you're using."</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Silicone does not cause allergies: <a href="https://lymed.fi/en/ufaqs/tuotteen-silikoninauha-aiheuttaa-ihoarsytysta-ja-nappyloita-onko-kyseessa-silikoniallergia-ja-miten-voi-ehkaista-sita/" title="https://lymed.fi/en/ufaqs/tuotteen-silikoninauha-aiheuttaa-ihoarsytysta-ja-nappyloita-onko-kyseessa-silikoniallergia-ja-miten-voi-ehkaista-sita/" class="https">https://lymed.fi/en/ufaqs/tuotteen-silikoninauha-aiheuttaa-ihoarsytysta-ja-nappyloita-onko-kyseessa-silikoniallergia-ja-miten-voi-ehkaista-sita/</a> "Based on literature, most of the reactions caused by silicones are non-allergic and non-specific. It is usually plain irritation, caused by skin’s properties, skin care products and hygiene – and the combination of them all. Individual elements, like pH of the skin, microbes, sweat, skin lotions and personal hygiene, can cause the irritation. Irritation can increase when sweating is more prominent – for example in higher temperatures. One can remove some of the irritation by cleaning the silicone band and the skin below it more frequently than before. The silicone band can be wiped clean several times a day. The skin below can be left lotionless."</li>

</p>

<h3>Actigraphy Axivity AX6</h3>

<p>
<ul>
<li>wristwatch arrow facing outwards towards the ground on the left wrist (and the Axivity logo on the wrist facing towards the body).</li>
<li>stick a hooks type velcro band (a strong one as used for mural supports, as it won't be in contact with the skin) on the face without an arrow, and then scratch the velcro side on the cotton wristband (the one with the iButton). Can be scratched on the exterior (prone to water damage but if worn up the arm and under clothes it should be fine) or inside the cotton wristband (more resistance to water damage but may be less comfortable and will likely deform the band, which may decrease the reliability of the iButton contact with skin and hence skin temperature measurements). The preferred way is to attach the Axivity AX6 on the exterior of the cotton wristband. Then, wear on the non-dominant arm, as it slightly less biases the results compared to the dominant arm.
<ul>
<li>Can also use the provided silicon watch-like support that is waterproof, but it's difficult to wear both the cotton wristband and the watch-like support for AX6, so will likely have to wear on different arms. But then one will be on the dominant arm, which is suboptimal as it can slightly bias the results, but it's better than nothing.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Core body temperature with GreenTEG CORE</h3>

<p>
<ul>
<li>Preferred way is to use a hooks-type velcro band (a strong one as used for mural supports, as it won't be in contact with the skin), <b>vertically</b> placed on the face facing the belt (ie, the face with the CORE brand marking), and use a sewable and skin-soft (eg, for babies, this side will be in contact with the skin from time to time) loops or loops-and-hooks type velcro band formed in a mobius loop to strap around the Polar Pro chest strap band, and then attach the CORE's velcro onto the mobius loop on the chest strap. This provide great comfort and improve skin contact and hence much more reliable measurements, and eliminates the mechanical pressure of the L dominoes as used in the manufacturer's instructions that eventually cause the CORE's outer ring to break. This technique can also be applied on already broken CORE devices.
<ul>
<li>Place the CORE on the chest's right or left side, below the armpit, as shown in: <a href="https://corebodytemp.com/coreclips/" title="https://corebodytemp.com/coreclips/" class="https">https://corebodytemp.com/coreclips/</a></li>
<li>Avoid twisting the Polar Pro chest band when removing or attaching the CORE, if you also use the band to acquire ECG with the Polar H10, as twisting the band can damage the electrodes.</li>
<li>Wearing a t-shirt while sleeping always improve the temperature measurements during the sleep sessions by reducing frictions with blankets and bed. During warm weather periods, try to tighten more the chest belt to compensate, although this will increase respiratory discomfort and itchiness.</li>
<li>ALTERNATIVE: according to this brain study, better place where there is soft tissues beneath, not bones, so on solar plexus. Indeed, DHF can acquire temperature 2cm below skin (DHF being the evolution of zero-heat-flux ZHF that consumes less energy): zero-heat-flux sensor for deep sensing of core body temperature if possible on the chest. Ref: Temperature Monitoring With Zero Heat Flux Technology In Comparison With Thermocouple Needle Probe During Selective Hypothermia, Mohammad Fazel Bakhsheshi et al, 2018. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1115/DMD2018-6930" title="https://doi.org/10.1115/DMD2018-6930" class="https">https://doi.org/10.1115/DMD2018-6930</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>IMPORTANT: Instruct the subject to regularly check and reposition the CORE device to be flat on the skin, as it's crucial that the device be in full contact with the skin for precise measurements. It's often necessary when changing positions or when laying in the bed. It's possible to move the sensor around (eg, more on the thorax, completely on the side or even slightly on the back, can also be moved up and down) with no loss of accuracy, what matters is full skin contact.</li>
<li>If the CORE cannot be discovered on the smartphone app anymore for unknown reasons and its green LED doesn't light up anymore, try to plug with the provided magnet cable to a computer USB port and the CORE, wait a few minutes, then disconnect. Connecting and disconnecting the CORE to the power outlet seems to systematically force it to turn back on. Nevertheless, even if there is no connection nor LED, the CORE continues to record data in the background even if it doesn't display it as long as there is enough battery left.</li>
<li>Alternative, but much less effective methods:
<ul>
<li>with strap: <a href="https://corebodytemp.com/coreclips/" title="https://corebodytemp.com/coreclips/" class="https">https://corebodytemp.com/coreclips/</a></li>
<li>with patches (may be able to replace with hypafix tape): <a href="https://corebodytemp.com/manual/mountingmaintenance/" title="https://corebodytemp.com/manual/mountingmaintenance/" class="https">https://corebodytemp.com/manual/mountingmaintenance/</a></li>
<li>"The preferred mounting site is below the armpit, directly on the rib cage on the are between pectoral muscle and latissimus muscle"</li>
<li>can be combined with Cardiosport strap for heart rate (900+h of battery life!!! + temperature sensor with TP5+ - but memory 16h max): <a href="https://www.cardiosport.com/cardiosport-heart-rate-monitors" title="https://www.cardiosport.com/cardiosport-heart-rate-monitors" class="https">https://www.cardiosport.com/cardiosport-heart-rate-monitors</a> - NO: low quality, uses PPG with green light (when PPG with red light is better and anyway it's not ECG contrary to what they write, it's only heart rate and PPG!)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>ECG Polar 10 and GreenTEG Core</h3>

<p>
<ul>
<li>Clean the Polar Pro chest band with a tissue with 50-70% alcohol, <b>except the connectors</b> to avoid oxydizing them. See <a href="https://support.polar.com/en/support/maintenance_of_heart_rate_sensor_with_textile_strap" title="here for more infos" class="https">here for more infos</a>.</li>
<li>Attach the GreenTEG Core or the same belt as the Polar H10, on the side, just after the silicone electrode band.</li>
<li>Wear the Polar H10 as indicated by the manufacturer.</li>
<li>Tip: to avoid the CORE overlapping one end of the electrode band, wear the H10 sensor shifted to the left quadrant of the torso. This will allow to leave more room to place the CORE on the right side of the chest without overlapping with the electrode band, and without any loss in ECG accuracy (since the heart is slightly oriented towards the left side of the torso).</li>
<li>Use a Bluetooth receptor to acquire the ECG data, see the next section.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Wrist skin temperature with iButton DS1925L and a cotton sports wristband</h3>

<p>
<ul>
<li>DS1925L is preferred over DS1922L as it has a MUCH longer battery, although the temporal resolution is reduced (1 sample every 5min = 0.0034 Hz), this should be sufficient to monitor the circadian rhythm since there are several studies using older iButtons with an even lower temporal resolution (1 sample every 10 min) and it worked for this very same application (estimation of the circadian rhythm from wrist skin temperature).</li>
<li><b>BEST CRITICAL: wrist skin temperature (distal temperature) placement using Velcro to attach the iButton to a cotton sports wristband! + one sample every 10min is fine, but we prefer to use one every 5min.</b> <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18761026/" title="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18761026/" class="https">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18761026/</a> : "In our experiments <b>iButtons were programmed to sample every 10 min, and were attached to a double-sided cotton sport wrist band using Velcro®, with the sensor face of the iButton being placed over the inside of the wrist, on the radial artery of the non-dominant hand</b>. <b>The non dominant hand was selected to reduce the potential masking effects generated by the higher activity of the dominant hand (i.e. writing in class, manual working...).</b> This procedure guarantees good skin contact with the sensor face of the iButton. <b>Wrist location was selected among other peripheral regions (ankle, sternum, armpit) after several trials performed in our laboratory, since it allows long term recording without significant complaints of discomfort from the subjects.</b> In addition, subjects could easily remove and replace the data logger when necessary (i.e., to have a bath or shower). After one week of monitoring, the information stored in the iButton was transferred through an adapter (DS1402D-DR8, IDC, Spain) to a personal computer using iButton Viewer v. 3.22© 1992–2005 Dallas Semiconductor MAXIM software provided by the manufacturer."
<ul>
<li>Using a cotton sport wrist band is a GREAT idea because it is flexible and hence allows to always press the iButton against the skin but not too hard and it conforms with movement, AND it also <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25813804" title="shields the iButton from ambient temperature" class="https">shields the iButton from ambient temperature</a>! Better than a medical tape!</li>
<li>aim for the radial artery close to the elbow instead? <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/arteries-of-the-body#organization" title="https://www.healthline.com/health/arteries-of-the-body#organization" class="https">https://www.healthline.com/health/arteries-of-the-body#organization</a></li>
<li>Studies demonstrating this is an optimal placement site:</li>
<li><a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physbeh.2006.04.026" title="this study tested on 14 different body sites, and ideal where on limbs + on trunk" class="https">this study tested on 14 different body sites, and ideal where on limbs + on trunk</a></li>
<li><a href="https://eudl.eu/pdf/10.4108/eai.20-5-2019.2282879" title="this other study" class="https">this other study</a> shows that wrist skin temperature was shown to be sufficient to estimate the circadian rhythm</li>
<li>BEST METHODS: for proximal temperature, abdomen and forehead not reliable! <b>Better to place iButtons on back or neck</b>! Skin Temperatures of Back or Neck Are Better Than Abdomen for Indication of Average Proximal Skin Temperature During Sleep of School-Aged Children, 2020 <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33061911/" title="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33061911/" class="https">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33061911/</a></li>
<li><b>CRITICAL: core body temperature versus proximal and distal (wrist) skin temperatures.</b> This shows why <b>proximal temperature such as on the trunk cannot reliably be used to estimate the circadian rhythm</b>. But core body temperature and distal (wrist) skin temperature both can. Ref: PhD Thesis: Crosstalk between Synchronizers and the Human Circadian System, D.

</ul>
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>Alternative sites and methods of wearing the iButtons, tested and considered less effective (with ineffective temperature measurements not reflective of the circadian rhythm, and much less comfortable to wear):
<ul>
<li>axillary = under the armpit, on the arm rather than the trunk to avoid sweat from corroding the iButton (it's not waterproof, only water resistante)</li>
<li>infraclavicular, which means <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deltopectoral_lymph_nodes#/media/File:Lymph_node_regions.svg" title="just below the clavicule" class="https">just below the clavicule</a>, check by touching to see if it's warm or reddish which means it's vascularized.
<ul>
<li>Alternative: 1cm above the navel</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>under the elbow or the interior of the wrist</li>
<li>any place on the body that is warm and/or reddish, meaning it's vascularized and radiating body temperature. If it's blank color, then preferably don't use this site.</li>
<li>Medical tape (comformable tape such as Hypafix) needs to be cut large enough (about 2x as large as the iButton's diameter) so that the iButton, placed in the middle of the tape, is entirely covered and also that all sides of the tape are in contact with skin.
<ul>
<li>For good fixation, tape in a cross-shape (2 bands in a cross, one on top of the other) if band too chin (&lt;5cm) or for &gt;5cm tape bands place the iButton in the middle of a 5x5cm square, so as to leave 1cm ("one-half inch") of tape on each side as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160615102653/https://multimedia.3m.com/mws/media/128297O/tips-for-trouble-free-taping-brochure.pdf" title="recommended by 3M in its &quot;Tips for Trouble-Free Taping&quot; guide" class="https">recommended by 3M in its "Tips for Trouble-Free Taping" guide</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Choose a flat skin surface, without hair, and with little to no deformation on movement (eg, avoid articulations).
<ul>
<li>That is also very important not only for the patch to stick but also for comfort. If properly placed on a flat surface, it should not become itchy even after a few days of wearing continuously.</li>
<li>If axillary (armpit), thy on the arm rather than the trunk</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If using multiple iButtons, distance them of at least 0.5cm apart so that they're not in contact and do not exchange heat.</li>

<h3>Light sensor</h3>

<p>
<ul>
<li>The selected light sensors are worn as pendants. This study shows pendants light sensors measure light with a close accuracy compared to eye-level light sensors (and much more than wristband light sensors), and they are much more comfortable.</li>
<li>The two available and selected sensors are:
<ul>
<li>A custom-made Arduino-based light sensor, can capture both light intensity and color. See next section. (Still under development - the hardware is available but not the software code to save measurements!).</li>
<li>HOBO Pendant Temperature/Light Data Logger UA-002-64 (Onset Computer Corporation, Bourne, Massachusetts, USA), acquire only light intensity (and with a bigger range than human eyes), not color
<ul>

<li>Price: 59.55 euros only!</li>
<li>Battery is replaceable! "The logger requires one 3-Volt CR-2032 lithium battery. <b>A new battery typically lasts one year with logging intervals greater than one minute.</b> Deployments in extremely cold or hot temperatures, or logging intervals faster than one minute, may significantly reduce battery life. <b>Continuous logging at the fastest logging rate of one second will deplete the battery in as little as two weeks.</b>" For combined light and temperature sensing! <a href="https://www.onsetcomp.com/files/manual_pdfs/9556-M UA-002 Manual.pdf" title="https://www.onsetcomp.com/files/manual_pdfs/9556-M UA-002 Manual.pdf" class="https">https://www.onsetcomp.com/files/manual_pdfs/9556-M UA-002 Manual.pdf</a></li>
<li>See figure D, spectrum captured is much wider than eyes... need to add a passband filter for the wavelength range of human eyes. <a href="https://www.onsetcomp.com/files/manual_pdfs/9556-M UA-002 Manual.pdf" title="https://www.onsetcomp.com/files/manual_pdfs/9556-M UA-002 Manual.pdf" class="https">https://www.onsetcomp.com/files/manual_pdfs/9556-M UA-002 Manual.pdf</a></li>
<li>TODO:
<ul>
<li>need to add an optical filter to reduce the light wavelength range to humanly observable light only (ie, remove UVs and infrared)</li>
<li>buy the PC USB adapter to transfer data (which incurs an additional cost)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>"This miniature data logger can record temperature and relative light levels. Complete with waterproof casing, this product is designed for indoor, outdoor, and underwater deployment. This model can store approximately 52,000 measurments of 10-bit readings. <b>Use a solar radiation shield for accurate temperature measurement in sunlight. </b>See RS1 Solar Radiation Shield (assembly required) and M-RSA (pre-assembled) Solar Radiation Shield. Note that using a solar radiation shield prevents the use of the light sensor."</li>
<li>"Data readout in less than 30 seconds via <b>fast Optic USB interface</b>" → very good idea, faster and more reliable than bluetooth!</li>
<li>"The UA-002-64 data logger supports the following measurements: Light Intensity, Soil Temperature, Temperature and Water Temperature"</li>
<li>So it only acquire light intensity, and in a range greater than human eyes (150-1200 nm). No color. But does acquire ambient temperature too simultaneously.</li>
<li>Sampling rate: one sample every 30s.</li>
<li>Used in <a href="http://hdl.handle.net/10201/40027" title="this incredible PhD study" class="http">this incredible PhD study</a>:
<ul>
<li>"According to the manufacturer specifications, the data logger has a measurement range between 0 and 320,000 lux, memory capacity for up to 28,000 values taken at regular, previously programmed intervals (in our case, every 30 s), and light-spectrum wavelength recording capacity of 150-1200 nm, which is broader than the sensitivity of the human eye. In order to validate the light sensor, a LX 101 lux meter (3E NDT, Pasadena, Texas, USA) was used to make a set of simultaneous recordings in different environments (data not shown). Readings from both devices demonstrated a strong, significant positive correlation at different intensities (r=0.997, p&lt;0.01). A high degree of repeatability of sensor measurements was observed when recordings were simultaneously performed with two different Hobo sensors (r=0.998, p&lt;0.01)."</li>
<li>BEST METHODS: "<b>Participants were instructed to wear the lux meter over clothing and to leave it on the bedside table during sleep. To compare the light exposure of our subjects to the natural sunlight cycle, environmental light intensity was recorded for 1 wk in the same area and for the same experimental period. To do this, a Hobo sensor was placed outdoors, facing North in a shady location to avoid direct light irradiance.</b>"</li>

<li>Main procedure to do each time:
<ul>
<li>Plug the iButton into one of the bluedot receptors.
<ul>
<li>Pro tip: buy a DS9093F+ plastic foab to easily plug the iButton out. It's easier to use than the other plastic foab that are supplied in the starter evaluation kit.</li>
<li>Pro tip 2: if you don't have a plastic foab, don't worry, you can just avoid pushing the iButton all the way through, it's possible to just slightly push until the iButton connects to the surrounding metalling ring, that's enough for the software to detect the iButton. Just maintain the iButton in this position with your thumb and release when you're done transferring data and configuring the next mission. This way, the iButton never gets stuck in place, and so you don't need any additional tool to remove it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>download data of previous acquisition (if there is one): Mission tab &gt; Temperature Data Log subtab &gt; right click on chart &gt; Save as .csv file
<ul>
<li>Battery gas gauge app: <a href="https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/design/technical-documents/app-notes/3/3761.html" title="https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/design/technical-documents/app-notes/3/3761.html" class="https">https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/design/technical-documents/app-notes/3/3761.html</a></li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>check the Real-Time Temperature tab that the iButton is working correctly (you can touch with your thumb to check that the temperature changes after a few seconds).</li>
<li>sync button clock to computer</li>
<li>click on the button "Start a new mission":
<ul>
<li><b>0.0625°C temperature precision</b></li>
<li><b>300s sampling rate for DS1925L ; 120s (2 min) sampling rate for DS1922L</b></li>
<li>For DS1922L only: <b>Enable rollover</b> (this will overwrite old data when the memory becomes full, this is necessary as I did not find a way to clean up the internal memory before a new mission, it seems File &gt; Wipe the device does not clean the memory, hence without rollover new data won't be saved after 10 days of experiment, even after the data is transferred, see Mission &gt; Total Device Samples count). This setting is unnecessary and unavailable for DS1925L as it can record years (4 years?) of data continuously due to its larger flash memory.</li>
<li>Disable SUTA and alarms but enable sampling and set 0 delay (so it starts recording asap).</li>
<li>Click OK</li>
<li>This is what the setup should look like if properly configured for DS1925L:</li>
<li><img src="./SleepNon24BiologicalMeasures_files/pasted_image011.png"></li>
<li>And here for DS1922L:</li>
<li><img src="./SleepNon24BiologicalMeasures_files/pasted_image.png" width="350"></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Deploy (ie, attaching to the body with medical conformable tape such as Hypafix)
<ul>
<li>Orient the iButtons in a top-side fashion, with the top (smaller round side) in contact with the skin and the bottom (wider flat base) in contact with the exterior tape. This is because the top side contains the sensor and the base contains the battery, the latter insulating against fast temperature changes, so the response to sudden temperature shifts is faster with the top-side orientation, as <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physbeh.2006.04.026" title="this study" class="https">this study</a> shows: "Upon contact with the hot plate, the iButtons with the top side facing the object were significantly warmer for the first 4 min than those with the bottom side against the object (Fig. 3). During exposure to the cold object the ‘top-side’ iButtons were significantly cooler during a 5-min period. We conclude that the top side has a faster response to thermal changes when placed on hard and flat surfaces. The difference between the bottom and top side thermal response may in part have been caused by the locations of the battery (towards the bottom) and the sensor (towards the top)."</li>
<li>It takes only 10min to converge to the skin temperature.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Notes:
<ul>
<li>This setup will last about 5.6 days before the internal memory is full on the DS1922L (4096K with higher temperature resolution) and about 212 days for the DS1925L (because limited to 61K recording limit with higher temperature resolution, half of the lower temperature resolution).</li>
<li>The internal battery will last about half a year before the iButton DS1922L is dead and 4 years before the DS1925L is dead. A paper shows <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/270579725_Replacing_the_batteries_on_ibutton_Thermochron_Hygrochron_data_loggers" title="how researchers could change the battery manually" class="https">how researchers could change the battery manually</a>.</li>

<li>Can then disconnect, unstuck the iButton and use Hypafix or Flexifix medical comformable tapes, very comfortable. Interestingly, also advised by <a href="https://axivity.com/userguides/ax3/using/" title="Axivity for actigraphy" class="https">Axivity for actigraphy</a>.</li>

<h3>Core Body Temperature: GreenTEG CORE</h3>

<p>
<ul style='padding-left: 30pt'>
<li>The CORE can record up to 3.5 days of data in its internal memory, after which data stops from recording further until download (ie, no rollover), but only with the RESEARCH model, which costs 999 CHF. The consumer-grade version that costs 250 CHF can only show the last 2 days of core body temperature and it does not allow downloads. The resolution is 1Hz. Breaks under 5 months when worn 24/7 with the L dominos, but likely much longer when using velcro.</li>
<li>Use any Android smartphone, use the CORE app on the Play store to download the data. It takes about 3.5h currently and the phone must not be used during this time. WiFi and Bluetooth must both be enabled (because the data will be sent online to GreenTEG's servers - although a local copy will be directly available).
<ul>
<li>The CORE device can only be paired with one single smartphone. Any other smartphone won't be able to detect the device until the first smartphone unpairs (ie, app is closed).</li>
<li>Troubleshooting: if after a data download, the CORE app does not detect the CORE device, try to restart the smartphone that was last paired with the CORE device, sometimes the app (or smartphone, eg Realme 6i) has a bug that keeps the bluetooth pairing activated but does not show up. Restarting the smartphone will fix this issue and the CORE device can then be paired with the same smartphone or with another.</li>

<h3>ECG (heart rate and heart rhythm) + 3-axis trunk Accelerometer Polar H10</h3>

<p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/polarofficial/polar-ble-sdk/blob/1d3ff05bccbd3a5ccc00731e941c73285248fa6b/technical_documentation/H10_ECG_Explained.docx" title="Polar H10" class="https">Polar H10</a>. Costs about 80€. Comes with a chest strap. Battery: 16.5 days with one button (CR2320) battery. Chest strap (Polar Pro) needs to be changed every 6 months when worn 24/7. 
<ul>
<li>The Polar H10 sensor needs to be paired via Bluetooth to a smartphone, and an app needs to be used at all times to record the ECG (because only heart rate can be stored on the internal memory). No cloud service registration required, all data is stored locally.</li>
<li>Use the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.j_ware.polarsensorlogger" title="Polar Sensor Logger app on Android" class="https">Polar Sensor Logger app on Android</a> by Jukka Happonen to log both the <a href="https://github.com/polarofficial/polar-ble-sdk/blob/1d3ff05bccbd3a5ccc00731e941c73285248fa6b/technical_documentation/H10_ECG_Explained.docx" title="ECG and accelerometer data" class="https">ECG and accelerometer data</a> with the sampling rate of your choice (up to 200Hz/8G for the accelerometer and 130Hz for the ECG - <b>we use 100 Hz and 4G</b> to save on memory and it is sufficient for research purposes). It also saves the Heart Rate in a separate CSV file, and the extra columns represent the RR-interval in milliseconds. The timestamp format is in nanoseconds and the epoch is 1.1.2000. Note that the app requires both bluetooth and location (GPS), hence to save battery, the phone can be set to Plane mode and wi-fi can be disabled, everything can be disabled except bluetooth and location, and the screen can be turned off during data collection. Data is stored in realtime in csv files in the sensorDataLogs folder at the device's root, so that even if the logging is interrupted due to a bug or the device being out of battery, the last logging session won't be lost.
<ul>
<li>Note that although the app can work with only bluetooth, it won't be able to seek and automatically reconnect to the Polar H10 sensor in case of disconnection without location (GPS) enabled.</li>
<li>Also to ensure automatic reconnection, it's necessary to enable the dual Bluetooth stream/pairing on the Polar H10 after each change of CR2025 battery (the memory is flushed then) using the official Polar Beats app. Note that this app requires enabling wi-fi temporarily (in addition to Bluetooth and GPS location) to pair with the Polar H10. This can be a good opportunity to also disable GymLink and ANT+ to extend the H10's battery life.
<ul>
<li>Here are the steps to do every time the battery of Polar H10 is changed: 1- restart phone (to free up connection slots) if the H10 can't be detected, 2- launch Polar Beats app (requires WiFi enabled to access the settings) and in the settings tap on the entry Receptor: Polar H10 and then enable dual receivers (ie, allows multiple devices to connect to Polar H10, this is necessary as otherwise when the data logger auto-reconnects, the Polar H10 may refuse the connection thinking the previous connection is still alive), 3- disable ANT+ and GymLink (to save battery, 4- Launch Polar Sensor Logger, enable ECG and ACC, connect, set 100Hz/4G (or a higher data collection rate for accelerometer), then click on Graph, activate all graphs, check that everything is alright and you can see your ECG, then pause the graph to save battery and leave Polar Sensor Logger in the forefront (don't multitask with another app as otherwise it will likely get killed). UPDATE: avoid activating graphs at all, once you have used the system a few times, because otherwise there is a memory overflow error that makes the app crash after 1 or 2 days after having displayed the graphs, even if they are completely disabled after! Hence, check the graphs only from time to time, and prefer stopping the recording, close the app, then relaunch it anew and start a new acquisition before leaving the acquisition unattended.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Check the ECG and ACC graphs (but disable HR as it will make the app crash after a long enough acquisition) to check if the acquisition is fine.
<ul>
<li><b>If the ECG data is all wrong but ACC is fine, try to change for another CR2025 battery</b>, sometimes a defective battery can mangle the signal for some reason.</li>
<li><b>If the ECG data is still wrong despite changing the battery, the Polar Pro chest band electrodes may be dead</b>, so it's then necessary to buy a new one (costs 30 to 40 euros for the band alone). If used 24/7, the Polar Pro band lasts for about 6 months. The warranty does not cover it as it is considered normal usage degradation of a consumable.</li>
<li>After you checked ECG and ACC graphs, reopen the menus to completely disable both graphs AND uncheck the device too, because otherwise the app may crash on autoreconnection when the H10 gets out of bluetooth range. It's always possible to re-enable the graphs at anytime to check, but it's necessary to disable them entirely meanwhile, not just pause them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Always maintain phone battery above 20% otherwise app will likely get killed to save battery whatever the battery saving settings </li>
<li>It might be a good idea to buy a dedicated <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/battery-test.php3" title="Android phone with a long battery" class="https">Android phone with a long battery</a>, which can allow to continuously record up to 10 days with a single charge (the generated data with accelerometer set to 100Hz and 2G is 400KB/min total for accelerometer+ECG+Heart Rate, so this makes for 6GB for 10 days, or 17GB/month, or 200GB/year of data, so it all fits in any modern smartphone's internal memory).
<ul>
<li>Using as a bluetooth receiver the <b>Realme 6i and its 5000mAh battery</b> (cost about 170 euros), the <b>battery consumption rate is 10%/24h, hence up to 9-10 days can be acquired with one full charge</b>.</li>
<li>Here are the steps to configure the Realme 6i to allow for continuous background task (as otherwise most Android smartphones automatically kill background apps when the screen is turned off) and low battery usage:
<ul>
<li>Enable developer's mode, then in developers options, set Background processes limit to 4 instead of standard limit.</li>
<li>Then in battery optimizations (specific to this phone) disable all except screen optimization and standby optimization.</li>
<li>Disable Do not disturb mode and any night mode, else they will kill apps during the night.</li>
<li>Also activate plane mode, disable wifi, close all apps except ecg and activate only bluetooth.</li>
<li>Finally, open the ECG acquisition app and lock it (tap on tasks button to show all windows then swipe down the ecg app window or tap on the 3 dots in the corner to enable the lock). Then go back to the app, launch the acquisition, then go to the graph tab, check if data is acquired alright and then click on the Pause button at the bottom of the Graph tab to disable graphs and save battery.</li>
<li>Now switch back to the main tab, check if the BPM and accelerometer values at the bottom are dynamically changing, if yes then all is ok and you can switch off the smartphone screen. You need to leave the app in focus at all time, do not switch another app, the ECG need to remain on the foreground to not be killed. Android 11 may fix this issue but for now smartphone vendors are too aggressive with background tasks killing so there is no other way around.</li>
<li>With all these steps done, the Realme 6i and its 5000mAh battery will be consumed at a rate of 10%/24h, hence with a full charge the ECG can be continuously acquired for 9 to 10 days! Which is an impressive feat that currently no other wearable ecg can do. Plus motion noise is greatly reduced thanks to the Polar chestband without dangling electrodes wires.</li>
<li>The data will be continuously saved in CSV files in the sensorDataLogs folder, even if the app or phone crashes at some point.</li>
<li>The Realme 6i needs of course to be kept within bluetooth range (ie, it can go through 2 thin walls but not the distance of a full apartment), so buying a <a href="https://www.amazon.fr/gp/product/B081BJRHK2" title="small shoulder bag for smartphones" class="https">small shoulder bag for smartphones</a> to carry the Realme 6i at all time on oneself is recommended. Do not use a neck strap, as the weight of the smartphone will be very noticeable, whereas with a shoulder strap it feels almost weightless, it's possible to get used to it and not feel carrying the shoulder strap bag, especially if carried under a jacket or pull as to reduce the degree of motion of the bag. Example of a smartphone shoulder bag:</li>
<li><img src="./SleepNon24BiologicalMeasures_files/pasted_image007.png" width="300"></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Alternative to get an even longer battery bluetooth receptor: make an Arduino-based bluetooth low energy (BLE = BT 4.0) logger to microsd card. <a href="https://github.com/SensorsIot/Bluetooth-BLE-on-Arduino-IDE/blob/master/Polar_Receiver/Polar_Receiver.ino" title="Some developers already made heart rate loggers for Arduino" class="https">Some developers already made heart rate loggers for Arduino</a> and Polar H7 chest bands (see also <a href="https://forum.arduino.cc/index.php?topic=116145.0" title="here" class="https">here</a> and <a href="https://makecademy.com/bluetooth-heart-rate-sensor-arduino" title="here" class="https">here</a>), but not the ECG, although the SDK is open so that should also be possible to do.</li>
<li>Using the Polar Beat app, the H10 sensor can be configured to have a dual Bluetooth stream, so that it can send data to two different devices/apps simultaneously. This can be used advantageously to concurrently continuously record the ECG data on one device, and use another device (the day-to-day smartphone) for when you want to visualize your current heart rhythm in real-time. To do this, install the Polar Beat app, pair the sensor, then go to the settings, click on the sensor and the sensor's options will show up, and then you can enable the "2 BLE receptors" option.
<ul>
<li>Using the Polar Beat app, <a href="https://support.polar.com/en/support/How_to_make_the_most_out_of_H6_and_H7_sensor" title="disable GymLink and ANT+ to significantly increase battery duration" class="https">disable GymLink and ANT+ to significantly increase battery duration</a>.</li>
<li>It's necessary to enable the dual Bluetooth stream to ensure auto-reconnection by the Polar Sensor Logger app.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This app is made by an employee of Polar (although this is not an official Polar app), so that it likely has a very robust and clean implementation respecting the Polar API.</li>
<li>Combined with the EliteHRV Android and iOS app, the Polar H10 can be used for breathing relaxation exercises (fundamental resonance breathing etc), and also be used as a biofeedback tool.</li>
<li>Big advantage of this setup compared to others: it really allows for continuous ECG, since there is no need to transfer data to restart a new session, as the phone's memory is used and it's vast. So only the smartphone's battery is the limitation, but it can be recharged while the acquisition continues, and even the data can be transferred concurrently using FTP or similar apps. This is a true 24/7 continuous ECG monitoring setup.</li>
<li>Use Sony or Varta CR2025 batteries for the H10 to last ~10 days with one battery. Cheaper or rechargable batteries won't last as long. Some users reported that CR2032 can also fit, and they last longer since they have a bigger size and capacity, but Polar warns against using a battery of an incorrect type (ie, anything else than CR2025) as they claim <a href="https://support.polar.com/be-fr/support/entretien-de-l-metteur-de-fr-quence-cardiaque" title="this can cause an explosion" class="https">this can cause an explosion</a>.</li>

<li>If after stopping acquisition, the Polar H10 is no longer detected by any app, reboot the Android phone, then the H10 should be detected correctly.</li>

<li>BEST circadian rhythm detection through actigraphy using nonparametric method: Multiscale adaptive analysis of circadian rhythms and intradaily variability: Application to actigraphy time series in acute insomnia subjects <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0181762" title="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0181762" class="https">https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0181762</a>

<li>"Circadian rhythms become less dominant and less regular with chronic-degenerative disease, such that to accurately assess these pathological conditions it is important to quantify not only periodic characteristics but also more irregular aspects of the corresponding time series. Novel data-adaptive techniques, such as <b>singular spectrum analysis (SSA)</b>, allow for the decomposition of experimental time series, in <b>a model-free way, into a trend, quasiperiodic components and noise fluctuations</b>. We compared SSA with the traditional techniques of cosinor analysis and intradaily variability using 1-week continuous actigraphy data in young adults with acute insomnia and healthy age-matched controls. The findings suggest a small but significant delay in circadian components in the subjects with acute insomnia, i.e. a larger acrophase, and alterations in the day-to-day variability of acrophase and amplitude. The power of the ultradian components follows a fractal 1/f power law for controls, whereas for those with acute insomnia this power law breaks down because of an increased variability at the 90min time scale, reminiscent of Kleitman’s basic rest-activity (BRAC) cycles. This suggests that for healthy sleepers attention and activity can be sustained at whatever time scale required by circumstances, whereas for those with acute insomnia this capacity may be impaired and these individuals need to rest or switch activities in order to stay focused. Traditional methods of circadian rhythm analysis are unable to detect the more subtle effects of day-to-day variability and ultradian rhythm fragmentation at the specific 90min time scale."</li>

</li>
<li>"The traditional method to analyse circadian rhythms is cosinor analysis, which quantifies the 24-hour (24h), and other periodic cycles, by means of examining the degree of “fit” between the data and a user-defined model consisting of a superposition of cosine functions [21, 22]. However, experimental data where the statistical properties vary over time (non-stationary data), such as having a dominant trend [23–25], or time-varying amplitudes, frequencies or phases [26–28], are much harder or impossible to describe using models based on these periodic functions. Another disadvantage of the cosinor method is that it is unable to detect rhythm fragmentation. With this in mind, the traditional approach, particularly for the analysis of actigraphy data, has been the measure of intradaily variability (IV), which is not model-based and hence is a nonparametric method. IV quantifies the frequency and the importance of transitions between periods of rest and activity, and for historical reasons is generally applied to hourly clustered data [2, 29, 30]. Although qualitatively different, the cosinor method and the IV method can be seen as complementary, where the focus of the former is the characterization of the 24h periodic aspects of the data, whereas the latter assesses the degree of rhythm fragmentation. Recently, more specialized techniques have been developed to study circadian rhythms (see Ref. [31] for a review). In particular, wavelets have been used to study circadian rhythms of nonstationary data [27, 28].

<li>"Based on a single time series, our Composite Phase Deviation method unveils distinct, subject- and schedule-specific geometries ('islands and pancakes') that illustrate how modern work times interfere with sleep. With increasing levels of circadian strain, the resulting shapes change systematically from small, connected forms to large and fragmented patterns. Our method shows good congruence with published measures of circadian misalignment (i.e., Inter-daily Stability and 'Behavioural Entrainment'), but offers added value as to its requirements, e.g., being computable for sleep logs and questionnaires."</li>

<li>Over time this internal clock will drift slightly. For single device applications, that can tolerate a drift of 50 parts-per-million (0.18 seconds per hour) no action is needed. However, when using multiple devices for a single capture session, aligning the data sets from several sources can become difficult. To overcome this, you can add an easily identifiable signal (e.g. claps at the start and end of capture), and tools are available to help synchronize this to an external clock or between devices. <a href="https://axivity.com/userguides/ax3/settings/#additional-sensors" title="https://axivity.com/userguides/ax3/settings/#additional-sensors" class="https">https://axivity.com/userguides/ax3/settings/#additional-sensors</a></li>

<li>Denoising: to clean up noise (denoising) of temperature data from home/wild settings, on humans at home and for circadian rhythm prediction:** "In contrast to most laboratory assessments, it seldom happens that field assessments are free of artefacts. Therefore an automated artefact rejection procedure was applied to exclude extreme drops and rises in temperature. Because of the bimodal rather than normal distribution of the temperature data, no artefact rejection was applied to exclude data more than two or three standard deviations from the mean, but rather a three-step nonparametric method. [...] the three-step artefact rejection procedure resulted in far fewer noisy distal and proximal curves, whereas the variability was maintained. Firstly, the rate of change (ROC) of all subsequent single channel data points was calculated, their quartiles Q25 and Q75, and their interquartile distance (IQRROC). Any data point with a rate of change exceeding 1 time the interquartile distance from Q25 or Q75 was removed. This step resulted in the rejection of very fast drops or increases in temperature. Secondly, in the resulting restricted raw data, the quartiles Q25 and Q75 and their interquartile distance (IQRLEVEL) were calculated. Any data point with a level exceeding 1 time the interquartile distance from Q25 or Q75 was removed. This step resulted in the rejection of very low temperatures. Thirdly, the resulting gaps in the single channels were interpolated linearly followed by an 11-point rectangular smoothing." <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physbeh.2006.04.026" title="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physbeh.2006.04.026" class="https">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physbeh.2006.04.026</a></li>

<li>ME IDEAS EXPERIMENTS DATA ANALYSIS:
<ul>
<li>how to test whether it measures sleep or circadian rhythm or something else? Check correlation with sleep sessions start time, wake up time and interval contained, should be weak for start time but mid for wake up time and interval contained (sleep sessions generally occur inside the circadian night). But now test whether sleeping in phase with circadian night (ie, start time and wake up time close ~1 ultradian cycle to circadian night start and end times) have a longer duration, if yes then that's a strong hint. Furthermore can test sleep quality, but sleep quality is directly correlated with sleep duration so it's a bit redundant. This would show that when the sleep session is aligned with the device's detected circadian night, the sleep is longer and of increased quality, which would strongly suggests that indeed the device does measure the core body temperature and circadian rhythm, as opposed to just sleep sessions. We cannot verify this on all nights because when the user sleeps outside of the circadian night then we have no way of verifying whether what the device detects as a circadian night is true or false. Can also do a quantitative analysis: compare how sleep duration is related to how close the sleep session is to the circadian night, I expect the further, the shorter sleep, this should show up as a nice inverse linear relationship between sleep-circadian rhythm misalignment and sleep duration.</li>
<li><b>BEST BETTER ANALYSIS: sleep schedule vs circadian night probabilistic window detection from core body temperature and correlation with sleep duration from sleep diary or actigraphy:</b> set an ideal sleep duration, eg 7 to 8h, then apply a probabilistsic model to find the most likely time the circadian night happened with such a duration (can be smaller or longer, but it will match the period with the closest duration and that is the low phase of the core body temperature). Could also be extended to find naps but it's likely more difficult. Then, calculate correlation between sleep diary's or actigraphy's sleep duration and distance or overlap with circadian night as detected by the probabilistic model. My hypothesis is that the most overlapping, the longer sleep and better quality. The opposite should hold true, the less overlapping, the shorter the sleep duration and quality. This would demonstrate that core body temperature indeed reflects the circadian rhythm AND that sleep in circadian misalignment leads to a shorter sleep. I expect that a longer sleep is observed only when at least half of the sleep session overlaps with the circadian rhythm (ie, 3-4h), otherwise if the overlap is less then it should be similar to sleeping in circadian misalignment, with sleep sessions not exceeding 5h. This should provide a nice inverse correlation between sleep-circadian distance and sleep duration. Then can also use sleep diary's tags such as LikelyPartiallyInPhase which means that the user estimates that there is an overlap of about half of the circadian night, but these tags are biased since they are subjective and they often rely on assessing sleep duration and expected circadian night window based on previous days/weeks. And LikelyInPhase should correlate with sleep durations &gt; 6h30 and PartiallyInPhase and OutOfPhase with sleep durations &lt; 6h.</li>

<li><b>BEST CRITICAL METHODS and idea: use 2 light intensity sensors, one normal for the full visible spectrum + one with a blue-green light filter, the difference of both sensors will show the amount of blue-green light that can modify the circadian rhythm!</b> <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/334043969_Determining_Light_Intensity_Timing_and_Type_of_Visible_and_Circadian_Light_From_an_Ambulatory_Circadian_Monitoring_Device" title="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/334043969_Determining_Light_Intensity_Timing_and_Type_of_Visible_and_Circadian_Light_From_an_Ambulatory_Circadian_Monitoring_Device" class="https">https://www.researchgate.net/publication/334043969_Determining_Light_Intensity_Timing_and_Type_of_Visible_and_Circadian_Light_From_an_Ambulatory_Circadian_Monitoring_Device</a>
<ul>
<li>My summary: The idea is to use a sensor for full visible light + same but blue light filtered, so that we can infer directly the intensity of blue-green light exposure which affects the circadian rhythm, contrary to using a color sensor which will be biased and only indirectly allow to calculate the intensity of exposure to blue-green light! It's very similar to what I was trying to make!</li>
<li>"an algorithm that allows to determine light intensity, timing and circadian light stimulation by differentiating between full visible, infrared and circadian light, as well as to discriminate between different light sources (natural and artificial with low and high infrared composition) in subjects under free living conditions. The ACM device is provided with three light sensors: (i) a wide-spectrum sensor (380-1100 nm); (ii) an infrared sensor (700-1100 nm) and (iii) a sensor equipped with a blue filter that mimics the sensitivity curve of the melanopsin photopigment and the melatonin light suppression curve."</li>
<li>But <b>why do they care about correcting infrared light??? To differenciate between the light source being natural or artificial:</b></li>
<li>"Here, we reported the spatial and spectral ability of a wrist worn ACM device provided with three light sensors that combines full spectrum, infrared and blue light simultaneous monitoring, <b>allowing not only intensity and timing of visible and circadian light exposure to be evaluated, but also to infer light source and thus, differentiate between natural and artificial light exposure</b>." → but no color detection! They only consider blue-green light exposure, but it's sufficient since it's the light that maximally stimulate the ipRGC cells! But using the other sensor we have access to the full spectrum anyway!</li>
<li>BEST CRITICAL: light sensor on the wrist does not make much difference in terms of detecting exposure to circadian light! (different from full light): "In order to facilitate the usability of the ACM device under normal living conditions, it has been designed to be worn on the wrist, discarding other placements closer to the eyes but much more uncomfortable for the subjects. Although, at first instance, it could be argued that this position could affect the accuracy of lighting measurements, <b>previous studies by Figueiro et al. (2013) have shown that differences in active circadian light exposure are surprisingly small, typically less than 10% on average, when data at eye and wrist level are compared</b>. Thus, light exposure measurement in other places than the eye seems to be also a reliable method when assessing circadian light exposure."

</ul>
</li>
<li>BEST CRITICAL METHODS: technical details about the light sensors: "To record visible light (400–700 nm), a combination of two sensors is used in KronowiseR , one of full spectrum ranging from 400 to 1100 nm and another for infrared light (from 700 to 1100 nm). The combination of these two measures allows, on one hand, to differentiate whether light source is natural or artificial and among these, if light is provided by sources with high or low content in infrared radiation, or by the sun, as those light spectra shown in Figure 6. The circadianeffective light is detected thanks to blue filter covering a second full light spectrum sensor. The selected blue filter shows a transmittance profile to sunlight that is highly coincident both with the spectral inhibition curve of melatonin (Brainard et al., 2001) and with the model of melanopsin sensitivity curve of the ipRGCs (Enezi et al., 2011), letting pass visible wavelengths between 380 and 590 nm and above 680 nm. Thus, the “dose” of active circadian light to which the subject is exposed to can be calculated without inferences from combination of blue and green detectors, as it happens with Actiwatch Spectrum (Cao et al., 2015)."</li>
<li>Comparison between Kronowise, Daisymeter and Actiwatch Spectrum: "To date, and to our knowledge, only two ambulatory devices are available for the detection of visible and circadian light: the Daysimeter (Bierman et al., 2005) and Actiwatch Spectrum (Phillips)."
<ul>
<li>"The Daysimeter, a head-mounted device, has been specifically designed for detecting light exposure, so its performance in this field is very interesting; however, the device only includes an accelerometer and must be placed close to the eyes, limiting seriously its ability to detect sleep and wakefulness states. In addition, and although its light sensor shows a sensitivity curve restricted to the photopic spectrum, it shows a significant drop between 550 and 600 nm, a band to which the human eye is sensitive (Dartnall et al., 1983; Roorda and Williams, 1999)."</li>
<li>"The second device, Actiwach Spectrum, was primarily designed for detecting sleep and wake rhythms (Young et al., 2009; Kripke et al., 2010), and later incorporated RGB detection. This latter consists of three color sensors for light in the long wavelength (∼600–700 nm), middle-wavelength (450–600 nm) and short-wavelength range (∼400–550 nm), which correspond to R, G, B spectral outputs and a broadband “white light” (W) output (Price et al., 2012; Cao et al., 2015). However, its sensitivity spectrum does not match the one for the human retina. It shows a bimodal pattern, with a main peak at short wavelengths and a secondary peak at long wavelengths. In contrast, in the 570–600 nm band, the device is practically non-sensitive. This band, apart from its sensitivity of human retina, is characteristic of discharge light sources such as fluorescent lamps (Figueiro et al., 2013). Consequently, the photometric measurements of these common light sources will be systematically biased with this device and circadian light stimulation must be indirectly deduced from data recorded by blue and green sensors."</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>"Considering that the most powerful zeitgeber for circadian entrainment is the light-dark cycle (Roenneberg and Foster, 1997; Roenneberg et al., 2003), its simultaneous recording with other output signal seems a must to obtain an integrative assessment on the circadian function. In this sense, KronowiseR can constitute a useful and comfortable tool to deep our knowledge on light synchronization effects while people maintain their usual lifestyle."</li>

<ul>
<li>"In 2008, Rea et al.68 proposed a quantitative method for estimating circadian entrainment and disruption in the field. Called phasor analysis, this method permits examination of the relationship between the 24-hour (circadian) light–dark exposure pattern, the stimulus, and the activity–rest pattern. The response is quantified in terms of the phase and magnitude of their joint circular correlation function. The joint circular correlation function is determined by calculating correlations (r, not r2) between the entire, continuously repeating time series of light–dark exposure data and the entire, continuously repeating time series of activity–rest data as one time series is rotated with respect to the other. The circular correlation function is decomposed into its Fourier components from which the 24-hour frequency component can be represented by a vector, called a phasor. The vector length, or phasor magnitude, represents the amount of circadian entrainment exhibited in the light–dark pattern and the associated activity–rest pattern; the greater the phasor magnitude, the stronger the correlation between the light stimulus and the activity response. The vector angle, or phasor angle, reflects the phase relationship between the 24-hour light–dark exposure pattern and the 24-hour activity–rest pattern."</li>
<li>Very stable results across species, between shift working humans and jet lagged rats (using an aberrant light exposure schedule).</li>
<li><img src="./SleepNon24BiologicalMeasures_files/pasted_image016.png"> Shorter = lesser magnitude = more circadian disruption (more consecutive nights worked)</li>
<li>"After three weeks under these conditions, oral glucose tolerance tests (measured over 120 minutes) showed that glucose area under the curve (AUC) was significantly higher after animals experienced the simulated shift-work schedules compared to the day-shift schedule. More importantly, the results showed a <b>significant negative correlation between phasor magnitude (a measure of circadian entrainment) and glucose AUC</b> (Figure 3). <b>A higher glucose AUC suggests a lower glucose tolerance, which is typically associated with higher risk for type 2 diabetes.</b>"</li>
<li>"These studies are of utmost importance as they demonstrate how the discussion about light’s effect on human health needs to shift to the relationship between light–dark and activity–rest patterns, and not just focus on LAN exposure and its impact on circadian disruption. Phasor analysis provides a method for quantifying circadian disruption in field and laboratory settings, as well as a bridge between ecological measurements of circadian entrainment in humans and parametric studies of circadian disruption in animal models, including nocturnal rodents."</li>

<li>"The <b>cardiovascular system is the major effector of thermal changes in thermoneutrality</b>. In thermoregulatory terms, blood means heat and cutaneous circulation is the variable heat insulator underneath the skin, which determines, depending on the skin proximity, the heat transference velocity. The cutaneous circulation is regulated by vessels patency that is controlled by the autonomic nervous system. <b>Ambient temperature changes are translated into blood redistribution, if weather becomes cool, blood will be stored in the “core” (trunk) to diminish heat loss by the “shell” (extremities), whereas in warmer conditions blood is redistributed toward the periphery to dissipate heat from the core (Figure 8), which is the same that occurs in wake and sleep conditions (Krauchi, 2007).</b> This <b>blood redistribution is controlled by sympathetic nervous system</b>, which <b>dilates and constricts peripheral vessels in general, and arteriovenous anastomoses more specifically</b> (which are abundant in glabrous skin and are widely innervated by sympathetic nerves)." → heart rate variability HRV (frequenty band between 0.05 and 0.1 Hz, see <a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2019.00530" title="https://doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2019.00530" class="https">https://doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2019.00530</a>) may be able to detect the biological night too by detecting when the heat redistribution is active???</li>
<li>"In addition, cardiovascular system shows, as it has long been known, circadian modulation in blood pressure and heart rate (Blazquez et al., 2012; Kräuchi et al., 2012; Veerman et al., 1995). Recently, <b>circadian rhythms have also been discovered in vascular tone and cardiac output</b> (Veerman et al., 1995). All these rhythms have a similar pattern with <b>high values during daytime and low values during nighttime</b>. Nowadays, it is suggested that <b>all these rhythms are a consequence of a circadian pattern in the sympathetic tone instead of the sleep-wake or rest-activity cycle dependence</b> (Furlan et al., 1990; Yamasaki et al., 1996). <b>The sympathetic activity pattern is reflected in the heart rate variability rhythm with an inverse pattern, that it is, variability is higher during rest phase (lower sympathetic activity) and lower during activity phase (higher sympathetic activity) (for review see Guo &amp; Stein, 2003)</b>."</li>

apart from slight interference due to a postprandial rise of pulse rate. For different<br>
subjects the increase in minute pulse rate was between IO and 15 per degree F<br>
increment in rectal temperature; and since temperature is known to affect the<br>
heart rate directly, the pulse rhythm could have been a simple consequence of the<br>
rhythm in temperature. The further observation that during and after a 14day<br>
period of thyroid administration the temperature and pulse rate rose and fell in<br>
parallel does not strengthen the case; the minute pulse rate change was here 26<br>
per degree F, so the parallelism was more probably due to two independent effects<br>
of thyroid hormone. Neither temperature nor pulse rate shows a circadian rhythm<br>
at birth; both become rhythmic at about the same age of 4-6 weeks (I IO) and<br>
increase in amplitude up to perhaps 2 years, although the age at which the rhythms<br>
are established cannot be determined with any high precision.<br>
A complete dissociation between these two periodicities, however, has been<br>
demonstrated (133) in subjects on abnormal time schedules in the Arctic.’ Thus<br>
Kleitman himself, when living on an 18- or 28-hr day, showed a continuing 24-hr<br>
temperature rhythm, while his pulse rate clearly followed an 180 or 28-hr rhythm.<br>
Unfortunately the conditions for these experiments were far from ideal; although<br>
an Arctic summer provided continuous daylight, the subjects were living in a<br>
community in which solar time was all too evident, with empty streets and closed<br>
shops at night. This circadian influence may have maintained the 24-hr rhythm<br>
in temperature. The immediate adaptation of pulse rate to a day of 18 or 28 hr<br>
suggests that there is no endogenous rhythm and that pulse rate is determined<br>
largely by habit, being low during rest and sleep and higher during activity; only<br>
if these influences are small is it also determined by the rhythm of body temperature. "

<li>BEST CRITICAL: Effects of circadian disruption on the cardiometabolic system, 2009 <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s11154-009-9122-8" title="https://doi.org/10.1007/s11154-009-9122-8" class="https">https://doi.org/10.1007/s11154-009-9122-8</a>

<li>"More recently, Ivanov et al. confirmed a circadian variation in average heart rate (R-R interval) and average standard deviation of inter-beat interval (STDRR) using a 38-hour CR protocol, with the longest R-R intervals (thus slowest HR) and largest STDRR (measure of parasympathetic cardiac modulation) occurring during the biological night [33]. Similar findings with regards to the presence of a clear circadian rhythm in autonomic cardiac modulation have been further supported by FD studies. Hilton et al., using a 27-day FD protocol, showed a circadian rhythm in pNN50 (a parasympathetic cardiac marker; the percentage of consecutive inter-beat intervals differing by more than 50 msec; for technical details see [34]), with a peak during the biological night (equivalent to ∼5 AM) and the trough during the middle of the biological day (∼1 PM to 5 PM) [35]. The authors further showed a marked drop in R-R (i.e., increase in HR) from ∼5 AM to 9 AM. The authors propose that the increase in HR preceding the drop in parasympathetic cardiac modulation may suggest an increase in cardiac sympathetic activity at that time. These observations were also consistent with a stronger daily rhythm in parasympathetic (root mean square of successive differences of the inter-beat interval) as compared to sympathetic (pre-ejection period) cardiac modulation, assessed using a simple and practical protocol designed to minimize masking effects of behavior and environment by measuring cardiac autonomic modulation repeatedly across day and night while minimizing influences of behavioral activity, posture, environmental light, and meal intake [36]."</li>
<li>"Specifically, Hu and colleagues studied the scaling exponent α of heartbeat fluctuations under FD conditions (11-day, 28-h cycle) [29]. [...] The scaling exponent displays a circadian pattern, with a peak, i.e. a value closer to a random occurrence of behavior, during the biological morning (equivalent to ∼10 AM), the time window during which epidemiological studies report the peak in adverse cardiac events and strokes and is lost after lesioning the SCN [29, 33, 39]."</li>
<li>"a series of laboratory studies in humans showing that <b>(a) HR show a circadian rhythm with low HR during the biological night, i.e. habitual sleep episode, and an increase during the biological day, i.e. habitual wake episode, (b) that the peak in vagal activity occurs during the biological night, whereas the peak of sympathetic activity occurs during the biological day</b>, and (c) the scaling exponent α of heartbeat fluctuations, a potential marker for the risk of an adverse cardiovascular event, exhibits a circadian rhythm with a peak in the morning. Results from animal studies established that (a) the SCN innervates the heart and other organs involved in hemodynamic control, such as kidney, vasculature and adrenal, via a multisynaptic pathway, probably including direct projections form the SCN to the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN), <b>(b) heart rate shows a circadian rhythm that is not the secondary result of a circadian rhythm in locomotor activity</b>, and that (c) ablation of the SCN leads to abolishment of the circadian rhythm in HR. Light, the major Zeitgeber of the circadian system and melatonin, the body’s internal dark signal, both impact cardiometabolic functioning in humans and animals. Light in humans has been shown to (a) acutely elevate HR, BP, core body temperature and cortisol and suppress melatonin during the biological night but not during the biological day, and (b) phase shift the rhythms of melatonin and cortisol. Correctly timed, light can help to facilitate re-entrainment of circadian rhythms after shift work or jet-lag, and potentially in treating ASPS and DSPS. Exogenous daytime and repeated nighttime melatonin administration has proven to be able to lower BP in normotensive and hypertensive subjects, with nighttime administration most clinically useful. Circadian misalignment, i.e. the mismatch of the circadian system with the desired sleep/wake cycle, is a hallmark of shift work and jet-lag and causes a multitude of negative symptoms and chronic exposure has been associated with several negative health consequences such as increased risk for cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity, and certain forms of cancer."</li>

<li>Cortical arousal = unconscious wakefulness: “Arousals, irrespective of the underlying mechanism, impact heart rate, blood pressure, and cardiac hemodynamics acutely, but, when frequent, may also disrupt the circadian rhythm of the CV system, which is associated with unfavorable metabolic profiles, such as higher blood pressure, dysregulated blood lipids, and insulin resistance,” said the study authors. <a href="https://www.ajmc.com/view/sleep-disturbance-associated-with-increased-risk-of-death-particularly-in-women" title="https://www.ajmc.com/view/sleep-disturbance-associated-with-increased-risk-of-death-particularly-in-women" class="https">https://www.ajmc.com/view/sleep-disturbance-associated-with-increased-risk-of-death-particularly-in-women</a> and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/eurheartj/ehab151" title="https://doi.org/10.1093/eurheartj/ehab151" class="https">https://doi.org/10.1093/eurheartj/ehab151</a></li>

<li>"The <b>circadian rhythm of core body temperature (CBT) is a well-documented physiological phenomenon</b>. Already in 1842, Gierse [6] had shown that his own oral temperature revealed a maximum temperature in the early evening and a minimum in the early morning hours with a maximum-minimum range of 0.9 °C. It had been <b>assumed for a long time that muscular activity (exercise) and digestive processes</b> were the most important factors for generation of the CBT rhythm [8]. Aschoff and his colleagues systematically explored the causes of this rhythm [1, 2]. He showed that the circadian rhythm of CBT is determined both by changes in heat production and changes in heat loss, and concluded that <b>heat production undergoes a circadian rhythm which is phase advanced by 1.2h with respect to the circadian rhythm of heat loss</b>, i. e. when heat production surpasses heat loss, CBT increases – transport of heat needs time. Therefore, <b>when we want to explain changes in CBT we need to know the relationship between heat production and heat loss</b>."</li>

<li>"The neurobiological mechanisms of both sleep and circadian regulation have been unraveled partly in the last decades. A network of brain structures, rather than a single locus, is involved in arousal state regulation, whereas the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) has been recognized as a key structure for the regulation of circadian rhythms. Although most models of sleep regulation include a circadian component, the actual mechanism by which the circadian timing system promotes--in addition to homeostatic pressure--transitions between sleep and wakefulness remains to be elucidated."</li>
<li>"A review of the literature shows that increased brain temperature is associated with a type of neuronal activation typical of sleep in some structures (hypothalamus, basal forebrain), but typical of wakefulness in others (midbrain reticular formation, thalamus). Not only local temperature, but also skin temperature are related to the activation type in these structures. Warming of the skin is associated with an activation type typical of sleep in the midbrain reticular formation, hypothalamus, and cerebral cortex (CC). The decreasing part of the circadian rhythm in core temperature is mainly determined by heat loss from the skin of the extremities, which is associated with strongly increased skin temperature. As such, alterations in core and skin temperature over the day could modulate the neuronal activation state or "preparedness for sleep" in arousal-related brain structures. Body temperature may thus provide a third signaling pathway, in addition to synaptic and neurohumoral pathways, for the circadian modulation of sleep."</li>
<li>"Finally, the model indicates that appropriately timed direct (passive heating) or indirect (bright light, melatonin, physical activity) manipulation of the nocturnal profile of skin and core temperature may be beneficial to disturbed sleep in the elderly. Although such procedures could be viewed by researchers as merely masking a marker for the endogenous rhythm, they may in fact be crucial for sleep improvement in elderly subjects."</li>

<li>RR intervals can have as many as 4 in one packet!
<ul>
<li>"Q: Why there are sometimes 0-4 RR-intervals? A: Bluetooth exchanges data around 1 s intervals and if your heart rate is around 60 bpm, then almost every RR-interval hits between data transmission. If you have heartrate eg. 40, then your RR-interval is over 1s =&gt; not every BLE packet contain RR-interval. Then if your heartrate is eg. 180, then there is at least two RR-intervals in BLE packet." <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.j_ware.polarsensorlogger" title="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.j_ware.polarsensorlogger" class="https">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.j_ware.polarsensorlogger</a></li>

<li>even if persistent mode, send taskbar notification and vibrate to signal that the device disconnected, maybe bad contact with chest belt electrodes and skin, so if we don't notify the user then they may acquire useless data.</li>

<li><b>MY OBSERVATIONS:</b>
<ul>
<li>GreenTEG Core: core temperature decreases and stays low when biological night or nap, but rises up when waking up in the middle of the night or when awake. A rise of core temperature (at an odd time such as before the usual time for the biological night) indicates an energy boost.</li>
<li>ECG: heart rate low and stable when asleep, but starts to become higher and more variable in the last cycle or even before if sleeping outside of the biological night, may be usable as a metric to indicate if one is sleeping under the biological night?</li>
</ul></li>
